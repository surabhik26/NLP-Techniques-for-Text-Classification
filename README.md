# NLP Text Classification

This repository contains an implementation of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for **text classification** tasks.  
It demonstrates how machine learning and deep learning models can be applied to classify textual data into predefined categories.  
The code is written in **Python** using libraries like **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, or **PyTorch**.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization.
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF, word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, etc.)
- **Model Training**: Training machine learning or deep learning models for classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.
- **Visualization**: Displaying performance metrics and model predictions.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need:

- Python 3.7+
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / SpaCy
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (if deep learning models are used)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Overview

The notebook includes:

- **Introduction to Text Classification**: Overview of tasks like sentiment analysis, spam detection, topic classification, etc.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text data for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Converting text into numerical features suitable for model training.
- **Model Implementation**: Building, training, and validating classification models.
- **Evaluation and Analysis**: Measuring model performance with multiple metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook is: **Amazon Fine Food Reviews**
